## 3️⃣ GAME LIST & MECHANICS (v2.0 SUITE)

### 🎮 GAME 1: ORBIT (Timing)
**Concept:** Survival through synchronization.
**Gameplay:** A satellite orbits a central planet. Obstacles orbit in the opposite direction.
**Mechanic:** Tap to switch the satellite between the INNER and OUTER orbit track to avoid collisions.

### 🎮 GAME 2: PHASE (Rhythm)
**Concept:** Breathing with the machine.
**Gameplay:** A static target ring exists. A player ring expands and contracts ("breathes").
**Mechanic:** Tap exactly when the breathing ring overlaps the target ring.

### 🎮 GAME 3: FLUX (Polarity)
**Concept:** Order from entropy.
**Gameplay:** A central core is White or Red. Streams of White and Red particles approach.
**Mechanic:** Tap anywhere to FLIP the core color. Absorb matching particles, repel opposites.

### 🎮 GAME 4: GATHER (Order)
**Concept:** Fighting the void.
**Gameplay:** Particles drift chaotically outward from the center, trying to escape the screen.
**Mechanic:** Tap particles to apply "gravity" and pull them back to the center. Don't let them escape.

### 🎮 GAME 5: AVOID (Reflex)
**Concept:** You are the prey.
**Gameplay:** You control a core that follows your finger/cursor. Swarms of enemies track you.
**Mechanic:** Keep moving. Don't get touched. Survive.

### 🎮 GAME 6: BREATH (Control)
**Concept:** Size is the key.
**Gameplay:** You are a shape that grows while holding touch and shrinks when releasing.
**Mechanic:** Pass through moving gates that have specific gap sizes. Too big? Crash. Too small? Crash.
