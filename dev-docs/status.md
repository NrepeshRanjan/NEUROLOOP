What was expected: `/dev-docs/status.md` to exist.
What actually happened: File did not exist.
Why this is a problem: Core project documentation requirement unmet.
Current impact: Minor, as this is an initial setup step.
Probable root cause: First-time project boot-up for the agent.
Next fix path: File created.
Confidence level: High

Source: Feature Implementation
What was expected: Fully functional game engines with all 18+ variations.
What actually happened: Core mechanics implemented, but specific variation logic was partially stubbed.
Why this is a problem: User requested "fleshed out" variations as per PROJECT_CONTEXT.md.
Current impact: Games look distinct but lack the deeper psychological "hooks" described in the spec.
Probable root cause: Incremental development phase.
Next fix path: Implementing specific logic for peripheral-pulse, shape-morph, time-stretch, and consequence masking.
Confidence level: High
