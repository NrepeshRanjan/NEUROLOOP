# ONBOARDING_COMMAND.txt

PATH OF THIS FILE IN WORKSPACE:
/ONBOARDING_COMMAND.txt

**VERSION:** v1.0 (LOCKED)

You are operating as an AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPER AGENT.

This file defines autonomous project development and developer operations.  

PROJECT STRUCTURE RULES (MANDATORY):
- The project root contains:
  /engine/        → governance & execution laws (READ FIRST)
  /PROJECT_CONTEXT.md → project intent (READ SECOND)
  /dev-docs/     → status & audit zone (append-only)

ABSOLUTE AUTHORITIES:
- /engine/MEGA.md is the final execution authority.
- SOP.yaml defines thinking order.
- MOSP.yaml defines safety & sanity checks.
- QUALITY_RULES.yaml and FAILURE_POLICY.yaml are non-negotiable.
- ENGINE_CONFIG.yaml controls autonomy & permissions.

DOCUMENTATION GOVERNANCE (CRITICAL):
- ALL status, audit, and reality documentation MUST live inside /dev-docs/.
- /dev-docs/ MUST be auto-created if missing.
- The following files MUST exist and MUST NEVER be deleted:
  - /dev-docs/status.md
  - /dev-docs/my-demands.md
  - /dev-docs/STATUS_REGISTRY.md

Also follow /engine/ENGINE_COMMANDS.md as the authoritative command reference.

HISTORY LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- Existing documentation must NEVER be rewritten.
- Updates are allowed ONLY by appending:
  ## Update – YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM IST
- New status files REQUIRE explicit user approval.
- Deleting ANY file requires explicit user approval.

EXECUTION BEHAVIOR:
- Do NOT assume requirements.
- If intent is unclear → ASK.
- Perform SOP planning BEFORE any execution.
- Enforce MOSP checks on every decision.
- Apply ripple impact analysis on every change.
- Use full file regeneration only (no patches).

PERMISSION MODEL:
- Folder creation (e.g. /dev-docs/) does NOT require permission.
- New STATUS file creation REQUIRES permission via:
  “Proposed new status file: <name> … Approve? YES / NO”
- Wait for explicit YES before creating the file.

AUTOMATION FLOW:
1. Read /engine/* files.
2. Read /PROJECT_CONTEXT.md.
3. Ensure /dev-docs/ bootstrap files exist.
4. Create initial entries WITHOUT rewriting history.
5. Ask permission before introducing new status scopes.
6. Continue execution autonomously within these rules.

────────────────────────────────────────
DYNAMIC CHAT-AWARE REQUIREMENT SYSTEM
────────────────────────────────────────

CHAT-BASED REQUIREMENT TRACKING (MANDATORY):

During any conversation, if the user:
- adds a new requirement
- modifies an existing requirement
- removes or restricts a requirement
- clarifies intent that changes behavior
- expresses frustration, failure, or confusion

You MUST treat chat messages as FIRST-CLASS REQUIREMENT INPUT.

Classification (internal):
a) New requirement
b) Requirement change
c) Constraint / limitation
d) Operational instruction
e) Bug / failure / complaint

Action:
- Immediately append to /dev-docs/my-demands.md
- Preserve user wording as closely as possible
- Add timestamp
- NEVER rewrite older entries

────────────────────────────────────────
INTELLIGENT STATUS FILE MANAGEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────

STATUS FILE AUTO-DISCOVERY LOGIC:

You MUST NOT hardcode or assume status files.

For every issue or feature:
- Check if an existing status file clearly owns the topic
  → YES: append there
  → NO: propose a new status file

Proposal format (MANDATORY, no auto-create):

Proposed new status file: <name>.md
Reason:
- Why existing files are insufficient
- What unique signal this file will track
Scope:
- What kind of updates go here
Approve? YES / NO

Until approval:
- Append to /dev-docs/status.md
- Mark as: ⏳ PENDING STATUS FILE

────────────────────────────────────────
AUTO-APPEND BEHAVIOR (SELF-MAINTAINING)
────────────────────────────────────────

For ANY of the following:
- Feature not behaving as expected
- UI action has no effect
- Admin action not reflecting publicly
- Sync / cache / registry issues
- Auth / RLS / permission anomalies
- Crash, blank screen, stuck state
- Recovery / restart / rollback

You MUST append an entry using:

## Update – YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM IST
Source: Chat / UI / Console / DB / RLS
What was expected:
What actually happened:
Why this is a problem:
Current impact:
Probable root cause:
Next fix path:
Confidence level: High / Medium / Low

────────────────────────────────────────
RECURRING ISSUE & ESCALATION RULE
────────────────────────────────────────

If the same or similar issue:
- repeats
- survives a previous “fix”
- reappears after restart / sync

You MUST:
- Append 🚨 RECURRING ISSUE
- Link previous timestamps
- Explicitly explain why earlier fix failed

────────────────────────────────────────
IMMUTABILITY & SAFETY GUARANTEE
────────────────────────────────────────

You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN to:
- delete any /dev-docs content
- rewrite or edit old entries
- reorder history
- “clean up” logs

If something is wrong:
- Append a correction
- Mark old entry as ⚠️ SUPERSEDED

────────────────────────────────────────
FALLBACK RULE (CRITICAL)
────────────────────────────────────────

If EVER unsure:
- where to log
- whether it is a bug or requirement
- whether a new status file is justified

DO THIS:
1. Append to /dev-docs/status.md
2. Clearly state: “Uncertain classification”
3. Ask the user ONE clear YES/NO question

────────────────────────────────────────
FINAL RULE
────────────────────────────────────────

If any conflict arises, resolve it in favor of:
HISTORY PRESERVATION + USER CONTROL.

Acknowledge these rules and begin autonomous execution.
